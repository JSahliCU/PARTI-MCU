These programs were designed for the PARTI pucks project. This git repository is to be cloned on to the RPI within each PARTI puck. Then the following commands are to be run within the repo

1. pip install -r requirements.txt
1. Ensure there is file at '/home/tbbg/serial_number' that contains the serial number printed on the outside of the puck
1. run the install.sh file from the root directory of the project
1. Use quicklook.sh to monitor the last 20 minutes of samples
